Contains all matlab file scripts for assignments given in EE735

HW4 Files:
1) newton.m - Contains the function to be called in q1_hw4 to be solved using Newton's Method
2) q1_hw4.m - Solves a set of two non-linear equations using Newton's Method
3) poisson_q2.m - Contains the Poisson Relation for an intrinsic Silicon substrate under the assumption that only electrons act as carriers
4) q2_hw4.m - Solves for the charge density(electron) in the Silicon Substrate
5) possion_sio2.m - Poisson Equations for SiO2-Si interface (MOS). Interfacial Voltage doesn't converge.
6) q2_interface_hw4.m - Same as q2 for Si-Sio2 interface
7) randomwalk.m - A random walk solution to 1D diffusion equation with (1/2 1/4 1/2) coefficients
